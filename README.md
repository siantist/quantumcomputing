Trying running this code in Intel Quantum SDK.


Ideas:
How to speed up (common nbd product of graphs) search for edges

How to use cycle bases as a bases, how to write the cycle bases in terms of qbits (?) and how to write min weight cycle basis algorithm

Notes from Programming Quantum Computers:
pg. 185: Matrix Encodings
Obvious way of encoding m x n matrix is to employ m QPU registers, each of length log_2 (n), to amplitude-encode each row of the matrix as if it was a vector.
